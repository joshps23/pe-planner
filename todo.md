## Known Issues to Address

### ðŸ”§ Drag Restrictions Issue

- **Potential Cause**: Elements may be inheriting position constraints from parent containers
- **Next Steps**: Investigate drag boundary calculations in `makeDraggable()` function

### ðŸ”§ Save/Load Functionality

- **Next Steps**: Test and update save/load functions to include activity metadata

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority

- [ ] Add more equipment types (mats, goals, targets)
- [ ] Create activity progression tracking

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add sound effects for interactions
- [ ] Implement dark mode
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create mobile app version

## Technical Debt

## Review Summary

### What Was Accomplished
The PE Activity Consultant has been significantly enhanced with multiple AI-generated layout suggestions, complete with instructions, rules, and teaching points. The application now provides a more comprehensive planning experience for PE teachers, with persistent analysis results and improved layout accuracy.

### Key Improvements
1. **User Experience**: Teachers can now choose from 3 different layout variations and see complete activity details
2. **Reliability**: Fixed critical bugs with element positioning and display
3. **Performance**: Added analysis caching to avoid redundant API calls
4. **Visual Design**: Cleaner UI with proper element sizing and positioning

### Technical Highlights
- Modular function design for easy maintenance
- Proper separation of concerns (UI, logic, API)
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Secure API integration through Netlify Functions

### Next Priority
Focus should be on fixing the drag restriction issue for loaded elements and ensuring save/load functionality works correctly with the new features.

Save plans should also save the layout dimensions

## Netlify Configuration Fix (2025-09-12)

### âœ… Fixed Invalid Redirect Rule
- [x] Identified invalid redirect rule in netlify.toml
- [x] Researched Netlify documentation using context7
- [x] Removed unnecessary redirect from `/.netlify/functions/*`

### Review Summary
**Issue**: Netlify deployment was failing due to an invalid redirect rule attempting to redirect from the reserved `/.netlify/functions/*` path.

**Solution**: Removed the entire `[[redirects]]` section from netlify.toml since:
- The `/.netlify/` paths are reserved by Netlify and cannot be used in redirects
- Netlify Functions are automatically served from `/.netlify/functions/` without any redirect configuration
- The redirect was attempting to redirect from and to essentially the same path (unnecessary)

**Result**: The netlify.toml now only contains the proper function directory configuration, which is all that's needed for Netlify Functions to work correctly.
