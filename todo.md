# PE Activity Consultant - Development Todo List

## Session: 2025-09-16 - Cross-Platform Coordinate Mapping Fix

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Mobile-Desktop Coordinate Mapping Issue
- **Problem**: Elements positioned incorrectly when plans saved on desktop were loaded on mobile (and vice versa)
- **Root Cause**: Positions were saved as pixel values that didn't scale to different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Implemented percentage-based coordinate system
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Updated savePlan() function** (js/main.js:543-604):
     - Now converts pixel positions to percentages before saving
     - Stores both percentage and pixel values for backward compatibility
     - Uses CoordinateSystem.pixelPositionToPercent() for conversion

  2. **Updated loadPlan() function** (js/main.js:667-820):
     - Detects if saved plan uses new percentage format or old pixel format
     - For new format: Converts percentages to pixels based on current court size
     - For old format: Estimates original court dimensions and converts to percentages
     - Handles both items and annotations

  3. **Backward Compatibility**:
     - Automatically detects old pixel-based saves
     - Converts old format to percentages on load
     - Adjusts for mobile vs desktop original save context
     - Maintains compatibility with all existing saved plans

- **Technical Details**:
  - Desktop court max-width: 900px
  - Mobile court: variable width based on viewport
  - Percentages stored as 0-100 values relative to court dimensions
  - Element center positions calculated for accurate placement

## Session: 2025-09-16 - Gamification Enhancement for Fun Activities

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

  - Removed `box-shadow` from main element
  - Moved shadow to cone base for realistic effect
- **File Modified**: `css/styles.css`
