# PE Activity Consultant - Development Todo List

## Session: 2025-10-31 (Part 2) - Loading Screen Brain Centering Fix

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Brain Emoji Centering in Loading Modal
- **Problem**: Brain emoji (üß†) was offset to the right and down from the center of the spinning circle in the loading modal
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. **Transform Conflict**: The pulse animation was using `transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale()` which completely overwrote the base CSS centering transform
  2. **Emoji Rendering Offset**: Browser emoji rendering has inherent baseline and padding offsets
  3. **Insufficient Container Size**: 48px container wasn't providing enough room for flexbox to properly center the emoji

- **Solution Implemented** (`css/styles.css` lines 1616-1642):
  - **Switched from transform-based to margin-based centering**:
    - Removed `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` from `.loading-brain`
    - Added `margin-left: -30px` and `margin-top: -30px` for manual centering
  - **Simplified pulse animation**:
    - Changed from `transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1)` to just `transform: scale(1)`
    - Animation now only handles scaling, not positioning
  - **Increased container size**:
    - Changed from `width: 48px; height: 48px` to `width: 60px; height: 60px`
    - Increased font-size from 48px to 50px
  - **Enhanced flexbox centering**:
    - Added `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, `justify-content: center`
    - Added `line-height: 1` and `text-align: center`

- **Technical Explanation**:
  - Margin-based centering is not affected by CSS animations (unlike transform)
  - Container positioned at `top: 50%; left: 50%`
  - Offset by exactly -50% of container dimensions using margins
  - Flexbox handles emoji baseline quirks internally
  - Scale animation operates independently of positioning

- **Result**: Brain emoji now perfectly centered in spinning circle, pulse animation works smoothly without position drift

- **Files Modified**:
  - `css/styles.css`: Updated `.loading-brain` styles and `@keyframes pulse`

- **Commit**: `0f5e05b` - "Fix brain emoji centering in loading modal"

## Session: 2025-10-31 (Part 1) - AI Theme Variation & Non-Linear Pedagogy Enhancement

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### ITERATION 5: Replaced Fantasy Power-Ups with Dynamic Difficulty Scaling
- **Problem**: AI was generating unrealistic "power-ups" like "Invisibility Cloak", "Dragon's Roar", "Freeze Defenders" that don't work in real PE settings
- **User Insight**: "Winners should face increased difficulty, not get easier advantages" - proper pedagogy for differentiation
- **Solution**: Replaced power-up system with dynamic difficulty scaling

**Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Fantasy Elements** (lines 481-549):
   - ‚ùå Eliminated: "Power-ups", "Invisibility Shield", "Freeze Ray", "Dragon's Roar"
   - ‚ùå Removed: Video game terminology and magical effects
   - ‚ùå Deleted: Advantage systems that make winners stronger

2. **Added Dynamic Difficulty Scaling** (lines 495-549):
   **Core Principle:** Success = Increased Challenge (NOT advantages)

   **5 Scaling Mechanisms:**
   - **Constraint Progression**: Winners use non-dominant hand, eyes closed, weaker techniques
   - **Distance/Space Scaling**: Winning team gets smaller zones, further distances
   - **Time Pressure**: Leaders get less time (10 sec instead of 20 sec)
   - **Defender Advantage**: Winners face closer/more defenders
   - **Supportive Handicaps**: Struggling students get helpful constraints (defenders start further, more time, easier positions)

3. **Implementation Examples:**
   - ‚úÖ "Leading by 5+ points? Now use non-dominant hand only"
   - ‚úÖ "Behind by 10? Defenders start 3 meters further from you"
   - ‚úÖ "Won 3 rounds? Must complete 5 passes before scoring (instead of 3)"
   - ‚úÖ "Winning team? Your scoring zones shrink to half size"

4. **Updated JSON Requirements** (lines 564-565):
   - Instructions must include dynamic difficulty scaling rules
   - Rules must have 2-3 difficulty adjustments based on performance
   - Explicit ban on fantasy power-ups

5. **Clear Examples** (lines 574-580):
   - GOOD: Realistic constraints with performance-based adjustments
   - BAD: Fantasy power-ups and unrealistic effects

**Pedagogical Benefits:**
- Prevents "snowball effect" where strong students dominate
- Keeps high performers challenged and engaged
- Supports struggling students without making it obvious
- Maintains balanced, competitive gameplay for all skill levels
- All mechanisms are physically implementable by teachers
- Clear, observable, and enforceable rules

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`: Complete power-up system replacement

#### ITERATION 4: Added Age Group Selector for Age-Appropriate Activities
- **Feature**: Added student age group selector to generate age-appropriate activities with suitable complexity, themes, and language
- **Implementation**:
  1. **UI Component** (`index.html` lines 224-234):
     - Added dropdown selector with 6 age groups:
       * Early Childhood (4-6 years)
       * Lower Primary (7-9 years)
       * Upper Primary (10-12 years) - default
       * Lower Secondary (13-15 years)
       * Upper Secondary (16-18 years)
       * Adult (18+ years)
     - Positioned below skill level selector in Activity Details section

  2. **Frontend Data Flow** (`js/api.js`):
     - Line 111: Added `studentAgeGroup` to activityDetails object
     - Line 288: Included age group in layout description sent to backend
     - Default value: 'upper-primary'

  3. **Backend Processing** (`supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`):
     - Line 371: Extract age group from layout data
     - Line 394: Parse age group from input string
     - Lines 414-422: Age-appropriate design guidelines for AI:
       * Early Childhood: Simple rules, short attention spans, focus on FUN
       * Lower Primary: Clear rules, visual cues, simple teamwork, safety emphasis
       * Upper Primary: Complex strategies, competitive elements, skill refinement
       * Lower Secondary: Advanced tactics, leadership roles, performance goals
       * Upper Secondary: Sport-specific skills, fitness focus, complex scenarios
       * Adult: Fitness/wellness focus, social interaction, injury prevention
     - Line 422: AI instructed to tailor complexity, language, themes to age group

- **Expected Results**:
  - Activities for 4-6 year-olds: Simple, fun-focused, lots of encouragement
  - Activities for 7-9 year-olds: Clear instructions, visual markers, basic teamwork
  - Activities for 10-12 year-olds: Strategy elements, competition, peer interaction
  - Activities for 13-15 year-olds: Complex tactics, leadership, self-directed
  - Activities for 16-18 year-olds: Advanced skills, fitness, competitive drive
  - Activities for adults: Wellness-focused, social, adaptable difficulty

- **Files Modified**:
  - `index.html`: Added age group selector UI
  - `js/api.js`: Capture and pass age group data
  - `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`: Process and use age group in AI prompt

#### ITERATION 3: Fixed Missing Cones Bug
- **Problem**: AI generated instructions mentioning cones (e.g., "corner cones", "center cones") but didn't include cone objects in the elements array, resulting in empty courts with text referring to non-existent equipment
- **Root Cause**:
  - When original layout had 0 cones, `equipmentCount.cones = 0`
  - AI followed "EXACTLY 0 cones" requirement literally
  - Fallback validation didn't trigger because `0 < 0 = false`
  - Result: Instructions mentioned zones marked by cones that didn't exist
- **Solution**: Implemented two-layer fix:

  **Layer 1: Smarter Prompt (lines 528-537, 553-565)**
  - AI must COUNT cone references in its own instructions
  - "corner cones" (4) + "center cones" (2) = minimum 6 cones required
  - Better to include MORE cones than mentioned than fewer
  - Original equipment count is informational, not restrictive for cones

  **Layer 2: Intelligent Fallback Validation (lines 641-685)**
  - Detects cone keywords in instructions: "cone", "cones", "corner", "gate", "zone", "boundary", "marker"
  - If instructions mention cones but elements array has 0 cones ‚Üí triggers auto-generation
  - Smart estimation:
    * "corner" mentioned ‚Üí minimum 4 cones
    * "center" mentioned ‚Üí minimum 6 cones
    * "gate/gates" mentioned ‚Üí 2 cones per gate (parses numbers from text)
    * Default for zone-based games ‚Üí 6 cones
  - Logs warnings and auto-adds missing cones with grid positioning

- **Result**: Layouts will now always have cones if instructions reference them, even if original layout had 0 cones
- **Files Modified**: `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`

#### ITERATION 2: Strengthened NLP Constraint Implementation
- **Problem**: Initial NLP integration was too abstract - AI generated ideas but didn't explicitly implement constraint variations
- **Solution**: Added concrete examples, explicit requirements, and verification checklist
- **Changes Made**:
  1. **Concrete NLP Examples with Checkboxes** (lines 428-465):
     - Each principle now has specific examples of what to say vs. what NOT to say
     - TASK: "Near cones = 3pts, far = 5pts, center = 10pts" vs. generic "score points"
     - ENVIRONMENTAL: "Easy path: wide gates on left. Hard path: narrow gates on right" vs. "use the space"
     - INDIVIDUAL: "Bronze/Silver/Gold challenge - YOU CHOOSE!" vs. "students participate"
     - DISCOVERY: "Find 3 ways to score" vs. "dribble in zig-zag"
     - REPRESENTATIVE: "Pass (safe) or shoot (risky)?" vs. "practice passing"

  2. **NLP Compliance Checklist** (lines 460-465):
     - ‚ñ° At least 3 different point values for zones/actions
     - ‚ñ° At least 2 distance options (near/far or easy/hard)
     - ‚ñ° Student choice between 2+ difficulty levels
     - ‚ñ° At least 1 discovery prompt ("Find 3 ways to...")
     - ‚ñ° Real game pressure (time limits, defenders, spatial constraints)

  3. **Explicit JSON Format Requirements** (lines 506-507):
     - Instructions MUST state: (1) Multiple scoring zones, (2) Distance options, (3) Discovery prompts, (4) Time/spatial constraints
     - Rules MUST include: (a) 3 scoring variations, (b) Student choice options, (c) Dynamic rule changes, (d) Power-up activation

  4. **Good vs. Bad Examples** (lines 516-520):
     - GOOD: "Near gates = 3pts, far = 5pts, center = 10pts. YOU CHOOSE! Find 3 routes! 30 sec before defenders move!"
     - BAD: "Dribble through cones in order. Practice your technique."

  5. **Verification Protocol** (lines 536-541):
     - AI must verify each layout before submission:
       - 3+ scoring variations clearly stated?
       - Student choice available?
       - Discovery/exploration prompt?
       - Constraints with specific examples?
     - If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí revise layout

- **Expected Results**:
  - Every activity will have explicit point variations (3pts/5pts/10pts)
  - Students will see clear choices (Bronze/Silver/Gold or Path A/B)
  - Activities will ask discovery questions ("Can you find...")
  - Constraints will be specific and actionable
  - No more generic "practice the skill" instructions

#### ITERATION 1: Enhanced AI Analysis with Dynamic Themes and NLP Principles
- **Problem**: AI was generating repetitive themes (always "Lava maze, Treasure hunt, Battle arena") regardless of lesson context
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic theme generation with Non-Linear Pedagogy integration
- **Changes Made**:
  1. **Theme Randomization System** (`supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts` lines 412-423):
     - Added THEME REQUIREMENTS section to prompt
     - Requires UNIQUE theme for each of 3 layouts
     - Provides 6 theme categories with examples:
       * Sports & Competition (Championship Finals, Olympic Trials)
       * Adventures & Exploration (Jungle Expedition, Arctic Exploration)
       * Missions & Challenges (Rescue Mission, Spy Training)
       * Fantasy & Imagination (Dragon Trainers, Wizard Academy)
       * Survival & Strategy (Zombie Survival, Island Survivor)
       * Cultural & Global (Around the World, Cultural Festival)
     - Themes must relate to lesson objective
     - Explicit instruction to avoid similar themes

  2. **Non-Linear Pedagogy (NLP) Integration** (lines 425-456):
     - Added MANDATORY NLP principles to every activity
     - **Task Constraints**: Vary scoring zones, object properties, rules, success pathways
     - **Environmental Constraints**: Vary distances, zone sizes, obstacles, asymmetric layouts
     - **Individual Constraints**: Easier/harder pathways, student choice, skill progression, role differentiation
     - **Discovery Through Play**: Problem-solving focus, decision-making, strategy discovery
     - **Representative Learning**: Real game scenarios, authentic constraints, embedded skills

  3. **Updated Critical Requirements** (lines 507-513):
     - Layout 1: Wide spread + exploration-focused theme
     - Layout 2: Compact central + competition-focused theme
     - Layout 3: Progressive/linear + challenge-focused theme
     - Each layout must demonstrate NLP principles

  4. **Increased AI Creativity** (lines 551-557):
     - Temperature: 0.3 ‚Üí 0.7 (more creative variety)
     - topK: 10 ‚Üí 40 (broader token selection)
     - topP: 0.8 ‚Üí 0.9 (more diverse sampling)

  5. **Enhanced Gamification** (lines 458-463):
     - Added multi-level scoring zones
     - Added achievement unlocks
     - Emphasized student choice and exploration

- **Expected Results**:
  - Each analysis will generate 3 completely different themes
  - Themes will be contextually relevant to lesson objectives
  - Activities will incorporate constraints-led approach
  - More creative and varied game designs
  - Better pedagogical alignment with modern PE teaching methods

- **Files Modified**:
  - `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`: Complete prompt redesign
  - `server.js`: Changed default port from 3000 to 8080

## Session: 2025-09-19 - Grid Locking with Alignment Guides

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Implemented Grid Locking Feature with Alignment Guides
- **Feature**: Elements automatically align when dragged near the same X or Y coordinate as other elements
- **Implementation**:
  1. **CSS Styles Added** (`css/styles.css` lines 2321-2348):
     - Created `.alignment-guide` class for visual guide lines
     - Horizontal guides span full court width (1px blue line)
     - Vertical guides span full court height (1px blue line)
     - Active state with increased opacity and stronger color
     - Smooth transition animations for appearance/disappearance

  2. **Alignment Detection Logic** (`js/main.js`):
     - Added `ALIGNMENT_THRESHOLD` constant (10px) for detection distance
     - Added `SNAP_STRENGTH` constant (5px) for snap distance
     - Created `findAlignments()` function to detect nearby elements (lines 514-548)
     - Checks all visible elements on court for alignment opportunities
     - Returns horizontal and vertical alignment positions when found

  3. **Visual Guide System** (`js/main.js`):
     - `showHorizontalGuide()` - Creates/shows horizontal alignment line (lines 551-562)
     - `showVerticalGuide()` - Creates/shows vertical alignment line (lines 577-588)
     - `hideHorizontalGuide()` and `hideVerticalGuide()` - Hide guides with animation
     - `hideAlignmentGuides()` - Cleanup function for all guides

  4. **Snapping Behavior** (`js/main.js` lines 400-480):
     - Modified `drag()` function to check for alignments during dragging
     - Calculates element center position for accurate alignment
     - Automatically snaps element to aligned position when within threshold
     - Works with grouped elements (they move together maintaining relative positions)
     - Cleans up guides when dragging stops

  5. **Test File Created** (`test-alignment.html`):
     - Comprehensive test page with visual feedback
     - Shows alignment status in real-time
     - Includes test scenarios (grid, row, random placement)
     - Displays which elements are aligned and on which axis

- **User Benefits**:
  - Easier to create symmetrical and organized layouts
  - Professional-looking alignment without manual pixel adjustments
  - Visual feedback makes it clear when elements are aligned
  - Works seamlessly with all element types (equipment, players, annotations)
  - Compatible with existing group dragging functionality

- **Technical Details**:
  - No performance impact - alignment checks only during active dragging
  - Guides are created on-demand and cleaned up after use
  - Respects element groups (grouped elements move together)
  - Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Session: 2025-09-19 - Net Visual Representation Update

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Updated Net Visual to Vertical Block Design
- **Problem**: The net had a complex mesh-like appearance that wasn't clear for PE activity diagrams
- **Solution**: Changed to a simple vertical rectangular block design matching standard diagrammatic conventions
- **Changes Made**:
  1. **Main Net Element** (`css/styles.css` lines 473-514):
     - Changed from horizontal (100% width) to vertical orientation (10px wide, 80px tall)
     - Removed gradient backgrounds and mesh patterns
     - Added simple solid light gray fill (#f5f5f5) with black border
     - Added brown base (#8B7355) representing the net stand
  2. **Equipment Preview Net** (`css/styles.css` lines 1052-1071):
     - Updated to match vertical block design (10px √ó 60px)
     - Consistent styling with main net element
  3. **Layout Preview Net** (`css/styles.css` lines 2233-2239):
     - Adjusted for mini preview (3px √ó 12px)
     - Maintained proportional appearance
- **Design Rationale**:
  - Vertical orientation represents side view of net (standard in PE diagrams)
  - Simple block design is immediately recognizable
  - Brown base clearly shows it's a standing net structure
  - Much clearer than previous mesh pattern
- **Test File Created**: `test-net-visual.html` for visual verification
- **Result**: Net now appears as a clear vertical block matching the reference image provided

#### Fixed Net Class Naming Issue & Added Rotation Feature
- **Problem**: Net elements were using inconsistent class names ('net' vs 'equipment-net')
- **Solution**: Standardized all net elements to use 'equipment-net' class
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Context Menu Detection** (`js/main.js` line 2635):
     - Changed from checking `classList.contains('net')` to `classList.contains('equipment-net')`
  2. **Toggle Function** (`js/main.js` line 2899):
     - Updated to check for 'equipment-net' class
  3. **CSS Selectors** (`css/styles.css` lines 473-514):
     - Changed from `.net` to `.equipment-net` for all styles
  4. **Element Creation** (`js/main.js` line 2217):
     - Added mapping to ensure 'net' type creates 'equipment-net' class
  5. **Preview Function** (`js/main.js` line 1616):
     - Updated to use 'equipment-net' class for consistency

#### Added Net Rotation Feature
- **Feature**: Nets can now be rotated 90¬∞ between vertical and horizontal orientations
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Context Menu Update** (`index.html` lines 413-419):
     - Added "Net Orientation" section to context menu
     - Shows "Rotate Net 90¬∞" option with rotation icon (üîÑ)
     - Only appears when right-clicking on net elements
  2. **JavaScript Functionality** (`js/main.js`):
     - Updated `showContextMenu()` to handle net elements (lines 2634-2638)
     - Added `toggleNetOrientation()` function (lines 2898-2915)
     - Toggles 'horizontal' class on net element
  3. **CSS Styling** (`css/styles.css` lines 499-514):
     - Added `.net.horizontal` class for horizontal orientation
     - Horizontal net: 80px wide √ó 10px tall
     - Base repositions to left side when horizontal
     - Smooth transition animation (0.3s)
- **User Interaction**:
  - Right-click (desktop) or long-press (mobile) on any net
  - Select "Rotate Net 90¬∞" from context menu
  - Net smoothly transitions between orientations
- **Use Cases**:
  - Vertical nets for activities like badminton, volleyball
  - Horizontal nets for activities requiring barriers or dividers
- **Test File Updated**: `test-net-visual.html` includes rotation tests
- **Result**: Nets can now be oriented based on activity requirements

## Session: 2025-09-19 - Mobile Group Dragging Fix, Save/Load Groups Fix & Mobile Group Selection Interface

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Mobile Group Dragging Issue
- **Problem**: Grouped elements were not dragging together on mobile devices
- **Root Cause**: The `getMousePosition()` function was incorrectly handling touch events
  - During `touchend` events, `e.touches` array is empty
  - Code was trying to access `e.touches[0]` which didn't exist on touchend
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `getMousePosition()` to properly detect touch event types
  - Added support for `e.changedTouches` during `touchend` events
  - Maintained separate logic for touchstart/touchmove (using `e.touches`)
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Modified `js/main.js` lines 107-139
  - Added explicit checks for event types ('touchstart', 'touchmove', 'touchend')
  - Desktop functionality remains completely unchanged (mouse events unaffected)
- **Test File Created**: `test-mobile-group.html` for testing the fix
- **Result**: Grouped elements now drag together properly on mobile devices

#### Fixed Group Information Not Persisting in Saved Plans
- **Problem**: When loading a saved plan with grouped elements, the groups were not preserved
- **Root Cause**:
  - `savePlan()` function didn't save the `groupId` from elements
  - `loadPlan()` function didn't restore the `groupId` or rebuild the groups Map
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `savePlan()` to include `groupId: item.dataset.groupId || null` in saved data
  - Updated `loadPlan()` to restore `groupId` and add 'grouped' class to elements
  - Added code to rebuild the global `groups` Map after loading elements
  - Updated `nextGroupId` counter to avoid conflicts with loaded groups
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Modified `savePlan()` at line 612 to save groupId
  - Modified `loadPlan()` at lines 727-731 to restore groupId
  - Added group Map rebuilding logic at lines 940-969
- **Result**: Grouped elements now remain grouped when saving and loading plans

#### Implemented Mobile Group Selection Interface
- **Problem**: Mobile users had no way to select and group multiple elements
- **Root Cause**:
  - No selection mode available on mobile
  - No multi-select capability on touch devices
  - Group/ungroup functions not accessible on mobile
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added "Selection Mode" button to mobile FAB menu
  - Created mobile selection toolbar with group/ungroup/clear buttons
  - Implemented tap-to-select functionality in selection mode
  - Added visual feedback (pulse animations, selection indicators)
  - Integrated haptic feedback for touch selections
- **Features Added**:
  - Toggle selection mode via FAB menu button
  - Tap elements to select/deselect them
  - Selection count display
  - Group button (enabled when 2+ elements selected)
  - Ungroup button (enabled when grouped elements selected)
  - Clear selection button
  - Done button to exit selection mode
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Dragging disabled during selection mode to avoid conflicts
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added UI elements in `index.html` (lines 52-87)
  - Added selection styles in `css/styles.css` (lines 2476-2605)
  - Implemented selection logic in `js/mobile.js` (lines 368-598)
  - Modified `js/main.js` to prevent drag during selection mode
- **Result**: Mobile users can now select multiple elements and group them together

#### Fixed Mobile Group Sync Issue
- **Problem**: After grouping elements via mobile selection mode, they weren't dragging together
- **Root Cause**: The `selectedElements` variable wasn't exposed to window object for mobile access
- **Solution**:
  - Exposed `selectedElements` to window object in main.js
  - Updated mobile grouping to properly sync with main selection system
- **Files Modified**:
  - `js/main.js`: Added `window.selectedElements = selectedElements` (line 3024)
  - `js/mobile.js`: Fixed mobileGroupSelected() to properly sync selections

#### Hide Desktop Group Tools on Mobile
- **Improvement**: Desktop group tools panel now hidden on mobile since mobile has its own interface
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `id="desktopGroupTools"` to the panel in index.html
  - Added CSS rule to hide panel on mobile devices (max-width: 768px)
- **Result**: Cleaner mobile interface without duplicate functionality

### üìù Repository Updates
- Successfully committed all changes with descriptive message
- Pushed to main branch on GitHub
- Added three test files for mobile functionality testing

## Session: 2025-09-17 - UI Fixes, Security Audit & Mobile Improvements

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Header Title Centering
- **Problem**: Title "PE Activity Consultant" was shifted left due to auth container
- **Solution**:
  - Modified `.header-top` to use `justify-content: center`
  - Made auth container absolutely positioned to not affect flow
  - Added `flex: 1` and `text-align: center` to title container
- **Files Modified**:
  - `css/styles.css`: Updated header layout CSS

#### Security Audit for API Keys
- **Performed full codebase scan for exposed credentials**
- **Findings**:
  - Google Gemini API key in `.env` (properly gitignored)
  - Supabase anon key in multiple files (OK - designed to be public)
  - Supabase URL exposed (OK - public information)
- **Recommendations**:
  - Regenerate Google Gemini API key as precaution
  - Keep `.env` in gitignore
  - Continue using Netlify Functions to hide API keys from frontend

#### OAuth Display Name Issue
- **Identified**: Google OAuth shows Supabase URL instead of app name
- **Solutions Provided**:
  - Option 1: Configure custom domain in Supabase (requires Pro plan)
  - Option 2: Set up custom Google OAuth credentials (free)
  - Option 3: Continue with current setup for development

#### Fixed OAuth Redirect to Localhost in Production
- **Problem**: Sign-in button redirects to localhost instead of production URL
- **Root Cause**: Supabase Dashboard URL configuration not updated for production
- **Solution**:
  - Must update URL settings in Supabase Dashboard (not in code)
  - Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration in Supabase Console
  - Update Site URL and Redirect URLs to production domain
- **Note**: The `supabase/config.toml` localhost references are only for local development

#### Fixed Mobile Sign-in Button Overlapping Title
- **Problem**: Google sign-in button covered the "PE Activity" title on mobile devices
- **Solution**: Added responsive CSS to reduce button size on mobile
- **Changes Made**:
  - For tablets/mobile (max-width: 768px):
    - Reduced button padding from 10px 16px to 6px 10px
    - Decreased font size from 14px to 12px
    - Smaller Google icon (14x14px instead of 18x18px)
    - Added margin-right to title for spacing
    - Vertically centered button in header
  - For very small screens (max-width: 400px):
    - Shows only Google icon (text hidden using font-size: 0)
    - Further reduced title font size to 1.3rem
    - Minimal button padding for compact display
- **Files Modified**:
  - `css/styles.css`: Added mobile-specific auth button styles (lines 2557-2585, 3055-3077)
- **Result**: Desktop layout remains unchanged, mobile UI is now usable

## Session: 2025-09-16 - Supabase Edge Functions Integration & AI Improvements

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed AI Response Format Compatibility
- **Problem**: TypeError when using Supabase - `suggestions.replace is not a function`
- **Solution**: Updated api.js to handle different response formats from Netlify vs Supabase
- **Changes**: Normalized response handling to work with both endpoints seamlessly

#### Improved AI Prompt for Better Game Instructions
- **Problem 1**: AI was using percentages (e.g., "Zone 1 is 25%-40%") instead of physical landmarks
- **Solution**: Added explicit rules to reference cones physically (e.g., "area between the red and blue cones")
- **Problem 2**: AI described cone zones but didn't include cones in the layout
- **Solution**: Made it MANDATORY to include all equipment in elements array
- **Added validation**: Auto-adds missing cones if AI fails to include them

#### Upgraded AI Model Configuration
- **Changed model**: From `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.5-pro` for better quality
- **Increased tokens**: From 10,000 to 30,000 for more comprehensive responses
- **Result**: Higher quality, more detailed activity suggestions

#### Successfully Integrated Supabase Edge Functions
- **Problem**: Netlify Functions timing out (504 Gateway Timeout) due to 26-second limit
- **Root Cause**: Large prompt with 4.7KB example JSON taking too long to process
- **Solution**: Migrated to Supabase Edge Functions with 60-second timeout

#### Implementation Details
1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Installed Supabase CLI via Homebrew
   - Initialized Supabase in project (`supabase init`)
   - Created `analyze-layout` Edge Function

2. **Edge Function Development**:
   - Ported `analyzeLayout.mjs` to TypeScript/Deno
   - Removed large example JSON from prompt (saved ~4.7KB)
   - Switched to `gemini-1.5-flash` model for faster responses
   - Set 55-second timeout (leaving 5-second buffer)
   - Reduced maxOutputTokens from 25000 to 10000

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Updated `js/api.js` with toggle between Netlify/Supabase
   - Added Supabase credentials (URL and anon key)
   - Set `window.USE_SUPABASE = true` to enable

4. **Files Created/Modified**:
   - Created: `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`
   - Created: `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index-standalone.ts` (for easy deployment)
   - Created: `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`
   - Modified: `js/api.js` (added Supabase endpoint support)
   - Modified: `.env` (added Supabase credentials)

5. **Deployment Status**:
   - Edge Function ready for deployment
   - User needs to deploy via Supabase dashboard
   - Environment variable `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` needs to be set

### üìã Deployment Instructions for User
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Create new Edge Function called `analyze-layout`
3. Copy contents from `index-standalone.ts`
4. Add environment variable: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
5. Deploy the function

### üéØ Results
- **60-second timeout** vs 26-second Netlify limit
- **Faster processing** with optimized prompt
- **Better reliability** for complex layouts
- **Seamless switching** between Netlify and Supabase

## Session: 2025-09-16 - AI Layout Variation Fix & Power-up Improvements

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Duplicate Layout Coordinates in AI Prompt
- **Problem**: All three AI-generated layout variations were returning identical element positions
- **Root Cause**: The example JSON in the prompt showed all three layouts with the exact same coordinates
- **Solution**: Updated the example to show three distinctly different layout patterns
- **Implementation**:
  - **Layout 1 (Ultimate Challenge Arena)**: Wide spread formation with corner cones and center elements
  - **Layout 2 (Battle Royale Showdown)**: Compact central box formation with side zones
  - **Layout 3 (Adventure Quest Champions)**: Progressive linear arrangement for level-based gameplay
- **File Modified**: `netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs` (lines 234)
- **Result**: AI now generates unique positioning strategies for each layout variation

#### Improved Power-up System to be Skill-Based and Realistic
- **Problem**: Power-ups were unrealistic (e.g., "run faster") or unrelated to lesson objectives (e.g., "do jumping jacks")
- **Solution**: Redesigned power-ups to be earned through lesson-specific skills
- **Changes**:
  - Removed magical abilities like "speed boost" and "teleport"
  - Added skill-based activations tied to lesson objectives
  - Power-ups now require demonstrating proper technique
- **New Power-up Examples**:
  - DOUBLE POINTS: Execute skill with proper technique (bounce pass, behind-back dribble)
  - SAFETY ZONE: Complete 5 consecutive passes = 10-second safe zone from tagging
  - FREEZE DEFENDERS: Complete challenge move = defenders count to 3 before moving
  - SKILL CHAIN BONUS: Link 3 different skills = triple points on next score
- **File Modified**: `netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs` (lines 163-172)
- **Result**: Power-ups now reinforce lesson skills rather than arbitrary exercises

## Session: 2025-09-16 - Cross-Platform Coordinate Mapping Fix

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Mobile-Desktop Coordinate Mapping Issue
- **Problem**: Elements positioned incorrectly when plans saved on desktop were loaded on mobile (and vice versa)
- **Root Cause**: Positions were saved as pixel values that didn't scale to different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Implemented percentage-based coordinate system
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Updated savePlan() function** (js/main.js:543-604):
     - Now converts pixel positions to percentages before saving
     - Stores both percentage and pixel values for backward compatibility
     - Uses CoordinateSystem.pixelPositionToPercent() for conversion

  2. **Updated loadPlan() function** (js/main.js:667-820):
     - Detects if saved plan uses new percentage format or old pixel format
     - For new format: Converts percentages to pixels based on current court size
     - For old format: Estimates original court dimensions and converts to percentages
     - Handles both items and annotations

  3. **Backward Compatibility**:
     - Automatically detects old pixel-based saves
     - Converts old format to percentages on load
     - Adjusts for mobile vs desktop original save context
     - Maintains compatibility with all existing saved plans

- **Technical Details**:
  - Desktop court max-width: 900px
  - Mobile court: variable width based on viewport
  - Percentages stored as 0-100 values relative to court dimensions
  - Element center positions calculated for accurate placement
