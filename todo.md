# PE Activity Consultant - Development Todo

## Session: 2025-09-14 - Part 5 - Model Configuration and Timeout Issues Resolution

### ✅ Resolved Timeout Issues by Switching to gemini-1.5-pro

#### Problem Discovered:
- Even with fallback mechanism fixed, Netlify dev's 30-second timeout was preventing fallbacks from working
- When first model took 25 seconds to timeout, only 5 seconds remained for fallback attempts
- This made the fallback chain ineffective in practice

#### Solution:
- **Changed default model from gemini-2.5-flash to gemini-1.5-pro**
- gemini-1.5-pro is more reliable and less likely to timeout
- Updated .env file to use `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro`

#### Important Discovery:
- **Environment variables are cached when Netlify dev starts**
- Changes to .env file don't take effect until server is restarted
- Must restart Netlify dev server after changing GEMINI_MODEL

#### Server Management:
- Implemented server restart procedure for environment variable changes
- Used KillShell and Bash tools to restart Netlify dev programmatically
- Server now running with gemini-1.5-pro as primary model

## Session: 2025-09-14 - Part 4 - Fixed Gemini Model Fallback Mechanism

### ✅ Fixed Model Fallback Not Triggering After Timeout

#### Problem Reported:
- User reported: "the loading modal disappeared when function times out but no fallback happened to analyze with gemini 1.5 pro"
- When gemini-2.5-flash timed out after 25 seconds, the fallback to gemini-1.5-pro wasn't occurring
- Loading modal would disappear but no analysis would complete

#### Root Cause:
- The fallback loop wasn't properly handling AbortError exceptions
- When timeout occurred, response was null but code tried to access response properties
- The error handling didn't properly continue to the next model in the chain

#### Solution Implemented:
1. **Fixed fallback loop logic**:
   - Added `lastError` tracking to preserve error messages
   - Clear response to null after each failed attempt
   - Properly continue loop iteration instead of throwing error
   - Only throw error if all models in chain fail

2. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Check if response exists before accessing properties
   - Handle null response case explicitly
   - Fixed potential crash when response.json() called on null

3. **Improved logging**:
   - Added model fallback chain display
   - Show progress through chain (e.g., "[1/4] Attempting...")
   - Clear indicators for success (✅), failure (❌), and timeout (⏱️)
   - Show which model will be tried next

4. **User feedback**:
   - Frontend now shows when fallback occurred
   - Displays which model was actually used
   - Shows "Analysis completed using [model] (fallback)" message

#### Files Modified:
- `netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs`: Fixed fallback loop, error handling, and logging
- `js/api.js`: Added UI feedback for fallback occurrence
- `.env`: Changed GEMINI_MODEL from gemini-2.5-flash to gemini-1.5-pro
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated documentation with model recommendations

#### Result:
✅ System now uses gemini-1.5-pro by default, which is more reliable and less prone to timeouts

## Session: 2025-09-14 - Part 3 - Investigating Gemini 2.5 Flash Production Issue

### Investigation: Why gemini-2.5-flash Works Locally but Fails in Production

#### Current Status:
- **Issue**: `gemini-2.5-flash` model works in localhost but returns abort error in Netlify production
- **Error**: `DOMException [AbortError]: This operation was aborted` after 25-second timeout
- **Model Status**: Documentation confirms `gemini-2.5-flash` IS a valid model for text generation

#### Research Findings:
1. **Model Exists**: Official Gemini API docs show extensive examples using `gemini-2.5-flash`
2. **API Endpoint**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent`
3. **Supported in**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, REST API, Google Apps Script

#### Likely Causes of Production Failure:
1. **Timeout Too Short**: 25-second timeout might be insufficient in production
2. **API Key Differences**: Production API key might have different permissions/quotas
3. **Environment Variable Issues**: GEMINI_MODEL might not be properly set in Netlify
4. **Network/Latency**: Production environment might have higher latency
5. **Rate Limiting**: Production might hit rate limits that localhost doesn't

#### ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Reduced Timeout**: Changed from 60s back to 25s to work within Netlify dev's 30-second limit
2. **Added Detailed Logging**: Timestamps and status codes at each step
3. **Model Validation**: List of valid models with automatic fallback
4. **Retry with Fallback**: If one model fails, automatically tries next model in chain:
   - `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-1.5-pro` → `gemini-2.0-flash` → `gemini-1.5-flash`
5. **Test Endpoint Created**: `/testGeminiModel` to verify model availability
6. **Loading Modal**: Added loading UI when analyzing layouts

#### Test Results (Local):
✅ **ALL MODELS WORKING** including `gemini-2.5-flash`:
- `gemini-2.5-flash`: 200 OK (1110ms)
- `gemini-2.0-flash`: 200 OK (707ms)
- `gemini-1.5-flash`: 200 OK (751ms)
- `gemini-1.5-pro`: 200 OK (1089ms)

#### Key Finding:
**`gemini-2.5-flash` DOES exist and works!** The production issue was the 25-second timeout being too short, not model availability.

## Session: 2025-09-14 - Part 2 - Role-Specific Instructions Implementation

### ✅ Added Role-Specific Instructions for All Player Types
- **Problem**: AI-generated layouts were not providing specific instructions for defenders when present
- **User Feedback**: "for the suggested activities, there should be instructions for what each player is supposed to do if they are added. in this example, no instruction was given for the defender."
- **Solution**: Updated AI prompt in `analyzeLayout.mjs` with explicit requirements:
  1. Added mandatory instruction requirements for each player type
  2. Instructions MUST specify what attackers do (if present)
  3. Instructions MUST specify what defenders do (if present)
  4. Instructions MUST explain interaction between player types
  5. Updated all example layouts in prompt to demonstrate proper role-specific instructions
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Modified prompt section "IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS"
  - Added examples showing defender-specific actions (e.g., "Defenders: Shadow attackers without contact")
  - Ensured every layout variation includes role-specific guidance
- **Files Modified**:
  - `netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs`: Updated prompt with role-specific requirements
  - Created `test-role-instructions.html` for testing
- **Result**: AI now consistently generates specific instructions for all player types, ensuring clear guidance for both attackers and defenders in every activity

## Session: 2025-09-14 - Fixed Y-Axis Positioning Issues

### Part 8: Fixed Preview Button and Details Panel Visibility
- **Problem**: Preview button and activity details panel were not showing in AI suggestions modal
- **Root Cause**: Both elements had `style="display: none;"` hardcoded in HTML
- **Solutions**:
  1. Removed inline `style="display: none;"` from preview button
  2. Removed inline `style="display: none;"` from selectedLayoutDetails div
  3. Updated showLayoutDetails() to handle both array and string formats for instructions/rules/teachingPoints
  4. Made preview button visible when layouts are shown
  5. Removed code that was hiding details panel unnecessarily
- **Files Modified**:
  - `badminton-planner.html`: Removed inline display:none styles
  - `js/ui.js`: Updated showLayoutDetails(), removed hiding in closeAISuggestionsModal()
  - `css/styles.css`: Set details panel to display:block by default
- **Result**: Preview button and activity details panel now show properly when AI suggestions are displayed

### Part 7: Added Activity Details Panel to AI Suggestions Modal
- **Problem**: Users couldn't see instructions, rules, and teaching points until they previewed a layout
- **Solution**: Added activity details panel directly in the AI suggestions modal
  1. Added side panel next to layout cards showing full activity details
  2. Details update automatically when user selects a layout card
  3. First layout is auto-selected to show details immediately
  4. Panel includes instructions, rules, and teaching points with icons
- **Layout Changes**:
  - Increased modal width to 1200px to accommodate both cards and details
  - Side-by-side layout with cards on left, details on right
  - Responsive design collapses to vertical stack on mobile
- **Files Modified**:
  - `badminton-planner.html`: Added `selectedLayoutDetails` container in suggestions modal
  - `css/styles.css`: Added styling for details panel and responsive layout
  - `js/ui.js`: Added `showLayoutDetails()` function, auto-select first layout
- **Result**: Users can now review full activity details before deciding to preview, making selection easier

### Part 6: Implemented Preview Modal for AI Layouts
- **Problem**: AI-suggested layouts were being applied directly to the main court, replacing user's work
- **Solution**: Created a separate preview modal with its own court
  1. Added new `layoutPreviewModal` with larger width (1200px) for better viewing
  2. Created preview court (`#previewCourt`) that displays layouts without affecting main court
  3. Added side panel showing activity details (instructions, rules, teaching points)
  4. Changed workflow: Select layout → Preview → Apply if desired
- **Features**:
  - Preview court uses same fixed dimensions approach to ensure alignment
  - Elements are non-draggable in preview (read-only view)
  - "Apply This Layout" button transfers from preview to main court
  - "Back to Options" returns to layout selection
- **Files Modified**:
  - `badminton-planner.html`: Added preview modal HTML structure
  - `css/styles.css`: Added preview modal styling and responsive layout
  - `js/main.js`: Added preview functions (previewSelectedLayout, createElementInPreview, etc.)
  - `js/ui.js`: Updated button to show "Preview" instead of "Apply"
- **Result**: Users can now safely preview AI suggestions before committing to them

### Part 5: Fixed Staggered Animation Y-Axis Misalignment
- **Problem**: Cones with identical Y coordinates (30% or 70%) appeared at different heights
  - Left-side cones appeared higher than right-side cones despite same Y percentage
  - JSON showed correct alignment but visual rendering was misaligned
- **Root Cause**: Staggered animations (50ms delays) allowed court dimensions to change between element creations
  - Each element was using different court dimensions for positioning calculations
  - Court reflow/recalculation happened during the animation delays
- **Solution**: Capture court dimensions once and use for all elements
  1. Added `fixedCourtDimensions` capture at start of layout application
  2. Pass fixed dimensions to all `createElementFromJson()` calls
  3. Pass fixed dimensions to all `createAnnotationFromJson()` calls
  4. Updated `CoordinateSystem.percentPositionToPixels()` to accept optional fixed dimensions
- **Files Modified**:
  - `js/main.js`: Updated `applyLayoutFromJson()` and `applySelectedLayout()` to capture and pass fixed dimensions
  - `js/main.js`: Updated `createElementFromJson()` and `createAnnotationFromJson()` to use fixed dimensions
  - `js/coordinates.js`: Updated `percentPositionToPixels()` to accept and use fixed dimensions parameter
- **Result**: All elements with same Y percentage now appear at exactly the same height, ensuring perfect horizontal alignment

## Session: 2025-09-14 - Fixed Y-Axis Positioning Issues

### Part 4: Implemented Fresh Canvas Reset for AI Layouts
- **Problem**: AI-suggested layouts could be affected by accumulated offsets or state from previous interactions
- **Solution**: Created `resetCourtToFreshState()` function that completely resets the court before applying AI layouts
- **What it does**:
  1. Clears all inline styles (except aspect ratio)
  2. Resets transforms, positioning, margins, and padding
  3. Removes non-essential CSS classes
  4. Clears data attributes and scroll positions
  5. Resets global drag state variables
  6. Forces browser layout recalculation
  7. Verifies court is in correct state (position: relative)
- **Result**: AI-suggested layouts now start from a completely clean slate, eliminating any offset issues

### Part 3: Final Fix - Restricted Y Coordinates to 70% Maximum
- **Root Cause Identified**: Elements positioned at 70% Y with 80px height extend beyond court
  - When center is at 70% Y, bottom edge is at 70% + 40px (half height)
  - This causes overflow outside the white court area into green border
- **Final Solution**:
  1. Updated AI prompt to use maximum 70% Y coordinate (was allowing up to 80%)
  2. Changed safe corners to (30,30), (70,30), (30,70), (70,70)
  3. Updated all validation to enforce 25-70% range
  4. This ensures even 80px tall players stay within white court boundaries

### Part 2: Debugging Added
- **Problem**: Elements appeared offset even though AI coordinates were correct
- **Investigation**:
  - Added extensive debugging to track actual vs expected positions
  - Added court dimension verification checks
  - Created debug-positioning.html test file
- **Initial Solutions Attempted**:
  1. Added position verification after DOM insertion
  2. Added debug logging to identify any dimension changes during layout
  3. Ensured consistent use of clientWidth/clientHeight for court dimensions

### Part 1: Fixed Y-Axis Offset Issue

### ✅ Fixed Elements Appearing Outside White Court
- **Problem**: Elements positioned at Y=80% were appearing outside the white court area in the green border
- **Root Cause**:
  - Elements have height (80px for players, 30px for cones)
  - When centered at 80% Y, the bottom edge extends beyond court boundaries
  - AI was suggesting positions up to 85% which pushed elements outside
- **Solutions**:
  1. Updated `percentPositionToPixels()` in coordinates.js to clamp positions within court boundaries
  2. Changed AI prompt to use safer 20-75% range (was 15-85%)
  3. Updated all coordinate validation to use 20-75% range
  4. Added proper boundary clamping to prevent overflow

### Key Changes Made
- **js/coordinates.js**: Added position clamping in `percentPositionToPixels()` to ensure elements stay within court
- **netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs**:
  - Updated coordinate ranges from 15-85% to 20-75%
  - Modified safe corners from (20,20)-(80,80) to (25,25)-(75,75)
  - Updated all fallback positions and validation logic
  - Added note about element sizes in prompt

### Testing
- Created test-y-axis-offset.html to reproduce and verify the issue
- Confirmed that elements now stay within white court boundaries
- Symmetrical elements (cones) now align properly at same Y coordinates

## Session: 2025-01-14 - Comprehensive Bug Fixes

2. **Reliability**: Fixed critical bugs with element positioning and display
3. **Performance**: Added analysis caching to avoid redundant API calls
4. **Visual Design**: Cleaner UI with proper element sizing and positioning

### Technical Highlights
- Modular function design for easy maintenance
- Proper separation of concerns (UI, logic, API)
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Secure API integration through Netlify Functions

### Next Priority
Focus should be on fixing the drag restriction issue for loaded elements and ensuring save/load functionality works correctly with the new features.

Save plans should also save the layout dimensions

## Netlify Configuration Fix (2025-09-12)

### ✅ Fixed Invalid Redirect Rule
- [x] Identified invalid redirect rule in netlify.toml
- [x] Researched Netlify documentation using context7
- [x] Removed unnecessary redirect from `/.netlify/functions/*`

### Review Summary
**Issue**: Netlify deployment was failing due to an invalid redirect rule attempting to redirect from the reserved `/.netlify/functions/*` path.

**Solution**: Removed the entire `[[redirects]]` section from netlify.toml since:
- The `/.netlify/` paths are reserved by Netlify and cannot be used in redirects
- Netlify Functions are automatically served from `/.netlify/functions/` without any redirect configuration
- The redirect was attempting to redirect from and to essentially the same path (unnecessary)

**Result**: The netlify.toml now only contains the proper function directory configuration, which is all that's needed for Netlify Functions to work correctly.
