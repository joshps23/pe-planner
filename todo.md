# PE Activity Consultant - Development Todo List

## Session: 2025-09-17 - UI Fixes & Security Audit

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Header Title Centering
- **Problem**: Title "PE Activity Consultant" was shifted left due to auth container
- **Solution**:
  - Modified `.header-top` to use `justify-content: center`
  - Made auth container absolutely positioned to not affect flow
  - Added `flex: 1` and `text-align: center` to title container
- **Files Modified**:
  - `css/styles.css`: Updated header layout CSS

#### Security Audit for API Keys
- **Performed full codebase scan for exposed credentials**
- **Findings**:
  - Google Gemini API key in `.env` (properly gitignored)
  - Supabase anon key in multiple files (OK - designed to be public)
  - Supabase URL exposed (OK - public information)
- **Recommendations**:
  - Regenerate Google Gemini API key as precaution
  - Keep `.env` in gitignore
  - Continue using Netlify Functions to hide API keys from frontend

#### OAuth Display Name Issue
- **Identified**: Google OAuth shows Supabase URL instead of app name

## Session: 2025-09-16 - Supabase Edge Functions Integration & AI Improvements

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed AI Response Format Compatibility
- **Problem**: TypeError when using Supabase - `suggestions.replace is not a function`
- **Solution**: Updated api.js to handle different response formats from Netlify vs Supabase
- **Changes**: Normalized response handling to work with both endpoints seamlessly

#### Improved AI Prompt for Better Game Instructions
- **Problem 1**: AI was using percentages (e.g., "Zone 1 is 25%-40%") instead of physical landmarks
- **Solution**: Added explicit rules to reference cones physically (e.g., "area between the red and blue cones")
- **Problem 2**: AI described cone zones but didn't include cones in the layout
- **Solution**: Made it MANDATORY to include all equipment in elements array
- **Added validation**: Auto-adds missing cones if AI fails to include them

#### Upgraded AI Model Configuration
- **Changed model**: From `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.5-pro` for better quality
- **Increased tokens**: From 10,000 to 30,000 for more comprehensive responses
- **Result**: Higher quality, more detailed activity suggestions

#### Successfully Integrated Supabase Edge Functions
- **Problem**: Netlify Functions timing out (504 Gateway Timeout) due to 26-second limit
- **Root Cause**: Large prompt with 4.7KB example JSON taking too long to process
- **Solution**: Migrated to Supabase Edge Functions with 60-second timeout

#### Implementation Details
1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Installed Supabase CLI via Homebrew
   - Initialized Supabase in project (`supabase init`)
   - Created `analyze-layout` Edge Function

2. **Edge Function Development**:
   - Ported `analyzeLayout.mjs` to TypeScript/Deno
   - Removed large example JSON from prompt (saved ~4.7KB)
   - Switched to `gemini-1.5-flash` model for faster responses
   - Set 55-second timeout (leaving 5-second buffer)
   - Reduced maxOutputTokens from 25000 to 10000

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Updated `js/api.js` with toggle between Netlify/Supabase
   - Added Supabase credentials (URL and anon key)
   - Set `window.USE_SUPABASE = true` to enable

4. **Files Created/Modified**:
   - Created: `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index.ts`
   - Created: `supabase/functions/analyze-layout/index-standalone.ts` (for easy deployment)
   - Created: `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`
   - Modified: `js/api.js` (added Supabase endpoint support)
   - Modified: `.env` (added Supabase credentials)

5. **Deployment Status**:
   - Edge Function ready for deployment
   - User needs to deploy via Supabase dashboard
   - Environment variable `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` needs to be set

### üìã Deployment Instructions for User
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Create new Edge Function called `analyze-layout`
3. Copy contents from `index-standalone.ts`
4. Add environment variable: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
5. Deploy the function

### üéØ Results
- **60-second timeout** vs 26-second Netlify limit
- **Faster processing** with optimized prompt
- **Better reliability** for complex layouts
- **Seamless switching** between Netlify and Supabase

## Session: 2025-09-16 - AI Layout Variation Fix & Power-up Improvements

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Duplicate Layout Coordinates in AI Prompt
- **Problem**: All three AI-generated layout variations were returning identical element positions
- **Root Cause**: The example JSON in the prompt showed all three layouts with the exact same coordinates
- **Solution**: Updated the example to show three distinctly different layout patterns
- **Implementation**:
  - **Layout 1 (Ultimate Challenge Arena)**: Wide spread formation with corner cones and center elements
  - **Layout 2 (Battle Royale Showdown)**: Compact central box formation with side zones
  - **Layout 3 (Adventure Quest Champions)**: Progressive linear arrangement for level-based gameplay
- **File Modified**: `netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs` (lines 234)
- **Result**: AI now generates unique positioning strategies for each layout variation

#### Improved Power-up System to be Skill-Based and Realistic
- **Problem**: Power-ups were unrealistic (e.g., "run faster") or unrelated to lesson objectives (e.g., "do jumping jacks")
- **Solution**: Redesigned power-ups to be earned through lesson-specific skills
- **Changes**:
  - Removed magical abilities like "speed boost" and "teleport"
  - Added skill-based activations tied to lesson objectives
  - Power-ups now require demonstrating proper technique
- **New Power-up Examples**:
  - DOUBLE POINTS: Execute skill with proper technique (bounce pass, behind-back dribble)
  - SAFETY ZONE: Complete 5 consecutive passes = 10-second safe zone from tagging
  - FREEZE DEFENDERS: Complete challenge move = defenders count to 3 before moving
  - SKILL CHAIN BONUS: Link 3 different skills = triple points on next score
- **File Modified**: `netlify/functions/analyzeLayout.mjs` (lines 163-172)
- **Result**: Power-ups now reinforce lesson skills rather than arbitrary exercises

## Session: 2025-09-16 - Cross-Platform Coordinate Mapping Fix

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Fixed Mobile-Desktop Coordinate Mapping Issue
- **Problem**: Elements positioned incorrectly when plans saved on desktop were loaded on mobile (and vice versa)
- **Root Cause**: Positions were saved as pixel values that didn't scale to different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Implemented percentage-based coordinate system
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Updated savePlan() function** (js/main.js:543-604):
     - Now converts pixel positions to percentages before saving
     - Stores both percentage and pixel values for backward compatibility
     - Uses CoordinateSystem.pixelPositionToPercent() for conversion

  2. **Updated loadPlan() function** (js/main.js:667-820):
     - Detects if saved plan uses new percentage format or old pixel format
     - For new format: Converts percentages to pixels based on current court size
     - For old format: Estimates original court dimensions and converts to percentages
     - Handles both items and annotations

  3. **Backward Compatibility**:
     - Automatically detects old pixel-based saves
     - Converts old format to percentages on load
     - Adjusts for mobile vs desktop original save context
     - Maintains compatibility with all existing saved plans

- **Technical Details**:
  - Desktop court max-width: 900px
  - Mobile court: variable width based on viewport
  - Percentages stored as 0-100 values relative to court dimensions
  - Element center positions calculated for accurate placement
